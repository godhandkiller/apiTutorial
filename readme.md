[Link to tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYXalBUj36w)

For this week maniak's time I decided to take a tutorial on how to create API using laravel. Since the project is gonna required and API and I never worked with api's before, I wanted to learn.

This tutorial shows examples on how to use the laravel tools availables to create api's like routes specially created to send information a json or resources that convert information to json.

The tutorial show me to create a Restful app, using the tools GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to show, create, upadte and delete records.

The tutorial also shows how to do a versioning of the functions so if you want to change the information in the future you can create a new version of the api instead of changing the one that you have.

The turorial was easy and very self explanatory, i was able to get the information from the database and show it throught a route specially created for my api project, in this case the route was created as a subdomain so you can access like api.your.app
